# So_Long

**So_Long** is a simple 2D game developed in C as a school project, where the player must collect all the coins on the map before reaching the exit. The game map is dynamically generated based on an input file.

### Responsibilities

As the sole developer, I was responsible for:

- **Game Logic**: Implementing movement, collisions, and the win condition.
- **Rendering**: Using **MiniLibX** to display the game world.
- **User Input Handling**: Managing player interactions via keyboard input.
- **Map Parsing**: Reading and processing external map files to generate levels.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: MiniLibX

### Challenges Faced

- **Low-Level Rendering**: Implementing graphics with **MiniLibX** while optimizing performance.
- **Game State Management**: Ensuring correct updates and interactions between game elements.
- **Dynamic Map Handling**: Parsing and validating external input to generate game levels.

---

### Outcome

The project successfully resulted in a fully playable mini-game that showcases:

- **Smooth 2D Rendering**: Using **MiniLibX** for efficient graphics handling.
- **Playable Game Mechanics**: A functional and interactive gameplay loop.
- **Demonstration of Programming Fundamentals**: Memory management, input handling, and game logic implementation.
